# Very basic site
This site has the only proposal for the SeniorTeam Web Application Manager to analyze me
It contains nothing very complicated.

# Requisites
The only requirements required by the test are these:
```
3 inputs:
# Product title;
# Product Description;
# Product Price;

Store it in any db that you know (please tell me what db you're going to use) and then display it in other page;
```

# Extra info
I didn't use a routing and object representation system for components and visualizations because it is a very very simple project. If you are going to use this, I highly recommend that you do so.
I also suggest that you protect "server files", such as **/componenets**, **/views**, **/config** and **/providers**. You can do this using your **.htaccess** file (in the case of Apache) or just with a custom PHP routing system.
